## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3100`. The application connects to a remote PostgreSQL database, so no local database setup is required. You will, however, need an active internet connection.
